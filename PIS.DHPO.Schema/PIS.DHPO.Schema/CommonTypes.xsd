			-   The concatenation of all external provider invoice reference numbers sorted alphabetically and separated by '@'.
			-   Rationale: In some insurer-provider relationships, the provider does not record the insurer's Claims number (ClaimIDPayer) and the insurer does not record the provider's Claim number either (ClaimID).
			-   Financial transactions are instead communicated using the provider's invoice number.
			-   The only way to reconcile payments at the level of a Claim is to define a reference number ClaimIDInvoice by concatenating each of the provider external reference numbers on the invoices relating to the Claim.
			-   This creates a unique key for the Claim, which can be created independently by the provider as well as the insurer.
			-   It can thus be used to uniquely identify a Claim.
			    -   Example 1: A provider submits a Claim to an insurer. The Claim has three invoices H00-1-op-017, H00-1-med-023, H00-2-sur-017. ClaimIDInvoice is "H00-1-med-023@H00-1-op-017@H00-2-sur-017"
			    -   Example 2: A patient goes to a hospital, receives an invoice for his treatment, and pays out pocket. The invoice number is H23-07-09-11-0124. ClaimIDInvoice is "H23-07-09-11-0124"
			    -   Example 3: A provider submits a Claim to an insurer. The Claim has only one invoice H001-1-op-984. ClaimIDInvoice is "H001-1-op-984"

Beds assigned temporarily for "holding" purposes in a no bed situation may be designated and included in hospital occupancy rate calculation (e.g. emergency room, recovery room).

			    -   Beds closed during renovation of patient care areas when approved by the competent authority
			-	Daycase bed: Daycase beds, also known as observation beds, are beds used in Day Care units such as surgical, medical, paediatric day care interventional radiology. They are not included in the inpatient bed complement.

			    -   Ambulatory patients: The condition or problem that explains the clinician's assessment of the presenting symptoms/problems and corresponds to the tests or services provided. This assessment may be a suspected diagnosis or a rule-out diagnosis and is based on the patient's presenting history and physical and the physician's review of symptoms. This may also be a symptom where the underlying cause has yet to be determined.
			    -   Note: A number of insurers code diagnoses related to specific Claims. Where this is done, the insurer should use this diagnosis to populate EncounterDiagnosisPrincipal.
			    -   Note: This field is key to understanding (what is wrong with the patient). It contributes to understanding the health of the population.
			-	Secondary:
			    -   Inpatients: All conditions that co-exist at the time of admission, or develop subsequently, which affect the treatment received and/or the length of stay. Diagnoses that refer to an earlier episode that have no bearing on the current hospital stay are to be excluded. Conditions should be coded that affect patient care in terms of requiring: Clinical evaluation, therapeutic treatment, diagnostic procedures, extended length of hospital stay, increased nursing care and/or monitoring.
			    -   Ambulatory patients | All co-existing conditions, including chronic conditions that exist at the time of the Encounter or visit and require or affect patient management.
			    -   External causes of injury, poisoning or adverse affect are coded as supplementary codes to the diagnosis codes of the actual condition such as Motor Vehicle Accident that caused a fracture of the tibia.
			    -   Note: For quality purposes, it is important to be able to track Hospital-acquired infections. 
			-	Admitting:
			    -   The diagnosis that the physician identifies at the time of admission.
			    -   Note:This diagnosis might differ from EncounterDiagnosisPrincipal.
			-	The classification is based on the International Classification for Disease version 10 clinical modification, US version, as outlined in the Medical Coding Guidelines published by the Dubai's Medical Coding Committee DMCC.
